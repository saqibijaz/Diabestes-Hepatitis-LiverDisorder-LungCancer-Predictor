* Download the Files & provide their valid paths.
* Impute missing values with the most frequent occuring values.
* change all the values of the DataFrame to float.

## Data Normalization
* Use Sk Learn min max scaler.
* Scale all the values between 0 and 1.

## Data Discretization
* Use Sk learn K bins Discretizor.
* Discretize your Dataset into bin of size 4 each.

## Features Selection
* Use Sk learn lasso cv.
* Selecting the top most relevant features of the dataset.
* This reduces the training time and hence has no impact on accuracy.

## KNN & Naive Bayes
* Trained KNN & Naive Bayes on the datasets.
* Compared both the Models.
* Naive Bayes confusion Matrix promised a better accuracy.
